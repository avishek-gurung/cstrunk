ARRAYS

Array are heterogeneous in Javascript unlike any other programming languages.
Array is also an object. 

Declaration of array can be done as follows:
var fruits = [];
var fruits = new Array();

Initialization of Array can be done as follows:
var fruits = new Array( "apple", "orange", "mango" );
var fruits =  ["apple", "orange", "mango" ];

We can iterate them as:
for(i in fruits)
  console.log(fruits[i]);

var points = new Array(40, 100);  // Creates an array with two elements (40 and 100)
var points = new Array(40); // Creates an array with 40 undefined elements !!!!!
We can use push and pop with arrays

** How to Recognize an Array? (Can be done for other data types also)
A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?
The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object" because a JavaScript array is 
an object.
arr.constructor.toString().indexOf("Array") !== -1 returns true for array else false :)

Since JavaScript arrays are objects, elements can be deleted by using the JavaScript operator delete
Using delete on array elements leaves undefined holes in the array. Use pop() or splice() instead.

SPLICE in Array
The splice() method can be used to add new items or delete items to an array.

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.splice(2, 0, "Lemon", "Kiwi");
The first parameter (2) defines the position where new elements should be added or deleted.
The second parameter (0) defines how many elements should be added or removed counting from the first parameter.
The rest of the parameters ("Lemon" , "Kiwi") define the new elements to be added.

It can be used smartly to delete an element from the array.
eg. to delete Orange and Apple, we can use
fruits.splice(1,2);

OR to add elements
fruits.splice(0,0,"Kiwi","Lichie");

The concat() method creates a new array by concatenating two or more arrays.
var arr1 = ["Cecilie", "Lone"];
var arr2 = ["Emil", "Tobias","Linus"];
var arr3 = ["Robin", "Morgan"];
var myChildren = arr1.concat(arr2, arr3);     // Concatenates arr1 with arr2 and arr3


OBJECTS

Initialization
var person = {};
var person = new Object();

Setting up the properties
person.name = "avishek";
person.age = 26

Small example of Object. Take note of colons, semi-colons and commas.

var person = {
  name: null,
  age: null,
  
  set: function(name, age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  },
  
  getName: function(){
    return person.name;
  },
  
  getAge: function(){
    return person.age;
  }
};

person.set("avishek",26);

console.log(person.getName());
console.log(person.getAge());


Iterating through object.

for(x in person) console.log(x+" ||| "+person[x]);

		name ||| avishek
		age ||| 26

		set ||| function (name, age){
		    this.name = name;
		    this.age = age;
		  }

		getName ||| function (){
		    return person.name;
		  }

		getAge ||| function (){
		    return person.age;
		  }


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.
JSON is language independent.
The JSON format is syntactically identical to the code for creating JavaScript objects.
Because of this similarity, a JavaScript program can easily convert JSON data into native 
JavaScript objects.

Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

JSON is very flexible when it comes to transporting data. JSON can be a combination of Object and 
Arrays.

Its very much similar to xml, just that it does not too contain many un-necessary tags and is simple.

JSON is normally transported as String. We parse them in the receiving application.

EXAMPLES:

1. Create a very simple JSON 

var employee = {};
employee.name = "avishek";
employee.age = 25;
employee.sex = "male";
employee.companies = ["flipkart","amazon","symphony"];

var text = JSON.stringify(employee);

console.log("JSON TEXT "+text);

var jsonObject = JSON.parse(text);

for(x in jsonObject){
		console.log(typeof(x)+"  "+x+" : "+jsonObject[x]);	
}

2. The above example is only for one employee. Say we want to create collection of such employee. The
we just need to create an array and push these employee object inside it. Thus making a collection of Object.

var employees = [];

//1st Employee
var employee = {};
employee.name = "avishek";
employee.age = 25;
employee.sex = "male";
employee.companies = ["flipkart","amazon","symphony"];
employees.push(employee);

//2nd Employee
var employee = {}; //We cannot resuse the same object, a new object has to be created everytime
employee.name = "Junith";
employee.age = 24;
employee.sex = "male";
employee.companies = ["yahoo","google"];
employees.push(employee);

var text = JSON.stringify(employees);
console.log(text+"\n");

for(key in employees){
	var singleObj = employees[key];
	for(x in singleObj){
		console.log(x+" : "+singleObj[x]);
	}
	console.log(" --------------- ");
}


One more example of JSON

var collections = [];

var person1 = {};
person1.name = "avishek";
person1.age = 26;
person1.company = ["symphony","vizury"];

var person2 = {};
person2.name = "shiraz";
person2.age = 26;
person2.company = ["mindtech","vizury"];

var fruits = {};
fruits.name = "apple";
fruits.color = "red";


collections.push(person1);
collections.push(person2);
collections.push(fruits);

for(x in collections){
  console.log("Name: "+collections[x].name);
  console.log("Age: "+collections[x].age);
  console.log("Color: "+collections[x].color);
}

RESULT

Name: avishek
Age: 26
Color: undefined
Name: shiraz
Age: 26
Color: undefined
Name: apple
Age: undefined
Color: red
