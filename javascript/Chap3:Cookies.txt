COOKIES

Cookies are some information that can be stored in the client's browser and retrieve it later. It thus allows us to identify
the client later. Cookie consists of name and value pairs. And each name=value pair in a cookie is seperated from one another
by semicolon ';'.

A Cookie has five different fields and they are:
1. name
2. expires (expiry date)
3. domain (domain name of the site)
4. path (path to the directory or the webpage where we need to set the cookie)
5. secure (if set, the cookie will retrieve with secure server)

If the expiry date is not set then the cookie will expiry on closing the browser.
The value of field 'name' cannot take space, comma and semicolon. If it contains any of them then we need to encode them by using
encodeURIComponent and again while retrieveing the value, we need to decode them by using decodeURICompoment.

The maximum size of a cookie that all browser supports is 4kb. If the cookie name is too large then we cannot delete the cookie.
The cookie is deleted by updating its expiry time.

FORMAT

The general format of cookie is as follows
cookie_name1=value1;cookie_name2=value2; ...;expires=Sun, 21 Sep 2014 15:35:19 GMT;domain=.myntra.com;path=/


Setting up a cookie

function setCookie(name,value,days){
	var expiryDate = new Date();
	expiryDate.setDate(expiryDate.getDate()+parseInt(days));
	document.cookie = name+"="+encodeURIComponent(value)+";expires="+expiryDate.toUTCString()+";path=/"; 
}
//In this same function we can store more than one cookie like
//document.cookie = name1+"="+encodeURIComponent(value1)+name2+"="+encodeURIComponent(value2)+";expires="+expiryDate.toUTCString()+";path=/";
// and so on

The toUTCString converts Date object to String according to universal time (GMT).
If the days is given as -1 then the cookie will expire.

If there are many cookies stamped for a given site then 
document.cookie will gives us the values as
cookie_name1=value1;cookie_name2=value2;cookie_name3=value3;...;cookie_nameN=valueN
Other fields of cookie like expiry time, path, domain name etc are not given.

So in order to get our respective cookie value, we can just split or use some regex (simple).

function getCookie(name){
  var cookieVal = '';
  var arr1 = document.cookie.split(name+"=");
  if(typeof arr1[1] !== 'undefined' && arr1[1] != null){
    var arr2 = arr1[1].split(';');
    if(typeof arr2[0] !== 'undefined' && arr2[0] != null){
      cookieVal = arr2[0];
    }
  }
  return cookieVal;
}

console.log(getCookie('avi'))

* we cannot access the cookies of other sites. 
* if we stamp a cookie in sub-domain, we cannot access in domain. But if we stamp a cookie in domain, we can access them in sub-domain.
Eg. We stamp a cookie in secure.myntra.com, then we cannot access this cookie in myntra.com. But we stamp the cookie in myntra.com then we
    can access the cookie in secure.myntra.com
