JAVASCRIPT DOM (Document Object Model)

The way the contents of the HTML document is modified and accessed is called Document Object Model.
The Objects in DOM are organized in hierarchy.

1. Window Object
2. Document Oject
3. Form Object

We know that in a browser, we have a window and inside that window, the HTML document is present.

1. Window Object
	
	The window object accesses and modifies the window in which the HTML document is loaded, i.e.
	the window object has control over the window in which the HTML document is loaded.

	This window object can access the properties of the current window like, window history, window 
	length, window.innerHeight, window.innerWidth etc but to resizing the width and height can be done 
	only for thos windows which has been created from script.

	Eg. var obj = open("","","width=200","height=200");
		obj.close();

	The document object can be considered to be lying inside window object. So window object has access
	to everything that document object has access.

	Eg, document.getElementsByTagName("div"); can also be written as 
	window.document.getElementsByTagName("div");
	console belongs to Window object

	All global variables are properties of window object.

2. Document object
	The document object accesses and modifies the HTML document which is inside the window.
	Common use:

	document.getElementById('id_name'); //gives a tag with the given id
	document.getElementsByTagName('span');//gives an array of span tags

	var node = document.createElement("div");
	node.innerHTML = "Avishek";
	node.setAttribute("id","wrapper");
	node.style.color = "Blue";
	node.style.margin = "10px 10px 10px 10px";
	document.body.appendChild(node);

	var obj = document.getElementById("wrapper");
	obj.getAttribute("id");

	parentNode.removeChild(childNode); // the childNode will be removed
	parentNode.appendChild(childNode); //Node appended at the end of all the children

3. Form Objects
  	Now inside the document obhect, is the form object, that allows us to access the form information
  	efficiently.

  	Lets say we have a form as follows:

  	<form>
		<input type="text" name="name" id="txt_name" size="30"><br>
		<textarea name="address" id="txta_address" rows="3" cols="35"></textarea><br>
		<input type="hidden" name="number_of_skillsets" value="12">
	</form>

	One way to access them is to use the name attribute 

	var form1 = document.forms[0];
	console.log(form1.elements['name'].value);
	console.log(form1.elements['address'].value);            
	console.log(form1.elements['number_of_skillsets'].value);

	Another wayto access is to use the index value

	var form1 = document.forms[0];
	console.log(form1.elements[0].value);
	console.log(form1.elements[1].value);            
	console.log(form1.elements[2].value); 

	The other way is to access is to use DOM properties and access them.
	That is pretty simple.
