P1. Given an array of size n and all the elements are in the range 0 to n-1. Find if any duplicates are present. (Best time and space complexity to be used).
P2. Given an array of size n and all the elements are in the range 0 to n-1. Find the element that appears max no of times. (Best time and space complexity to be used).
P3. WAP to find the first repeating element in an array, eg if arr ={3,2,1,2,2,3} then the ans is 3 and not 2
P4. Array is of size n-1, elements are non repeating in the range 1 to n. Find the missing element. (asked by Krishna to me in Vizury) **
P5. Given an array of size n+2.All elements are in the range 1 to n and they are non repeated except two elements, which are repeated. Find these two elements
P6. Given an array. Find the two elements whose sum is equal to k.
P7. Given an array. Find the three elements, i,j and k where a[i2] = a[j2]+a[k2]. i2 is i square.
P8. Given an array of +ve and -ve nos. Find the two elements whoes sum is closest to zero.
P9. Given an array find three integers whose sum is equal to k.
P10. We have an array with only 1s and 0s. eg [11111 .... 11110000 ....0000]. Assume there are millions of 0 and 1. Find the first index of 0. We do not know the size of an array
P11. Searching in Rotating Arrays or Biotonic Search. Complexity O(logn)
P12. Find the first and the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array in O(logn) time.
P13. Given a sorted array, find the number of occurrence of a given element in O(logn) time.
P14. Find the majority element. Meaning, an element whose occurrences is more than n/2 where n is the size of a an array.
P15. Array is of size 2n, one element repeats n times where as all other elements are unique. Find the element.
P16. An nXn array, where the row and the column are in ascending order. Give O(n) algo to search an element.
P17. Give a matrix where elements are only 1s and 0s and all 0s are followed by 1s. Find the row which has max no of zeroes.
P18. Solve Dutch Flag Problem.
P19. Array with 0s and 1s, sort them in one scan.
P20. Given an array of even and odd numbers, put all the even nos before odd numbers.
P21. Array of size 2n with format a1,a2,a3... an,b1,b2,b3... bn. Shuffle it in a1,b1,a2,b2,...,an,bn
