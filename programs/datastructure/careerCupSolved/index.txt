P1. (AMAZON) Given ~300k words with an average length of 7 in a file. 
All words are dictionary correct words. 
Print all the anagrams that are present in this list of words without repeating them. 

E.g. if the list has: 
ACT 
BAT 
CAT 
TAB 
TAC 

print: 
ACT, CAT, TAC 
BAT, TAB

2. (Google) Write a program to implement Double Linked List from Stack with min. complexity.

3. (EPIC) Generate stepping number from a given range. Stepping are those numbers where the difference between adjacent number is one. And the last and first number's difference is also one. Eg 1232, 6545 etc

4. (FACEBOOK) You're given an array of integers(eg [3,4,7,1,2,9,8]) Find the index of values that satisfy A+B = C + D, where A,B,C & D are integers values in the array. 

Eg: Given [3,4,7,1,2,9,8] array 
The following 
3+7 = 1+ 9 satisfies A+B=C+D 
so print (0,2,3,5)

5. We have 'n' patients and 'm' problems. The problems are of boolean type. Eg diabetes problem would be 'T' if a patient has it or 'F' otherwise. Suggest the data structure you would store this scenario on? 

6. (EPIC) We have a set of problems {diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease} find all the patients who have 
at least the 3 problems from the set. 
The number of patients can be huge (n). 
The number of problems not comparatively huge (m). 
Which would be the best data structure to store these kind of records, so that we have a better search time.

7. (KOMLI) Designing LRU Cache.

8. (KOMLI) How will you reverse a string word by word without using to much of extra space.
